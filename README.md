# Interactive Geography Game
A fun quiz game meant to help you learn about geography. Learn country names, locations, flags, and capitals through the various game modes.


I wanted to create a fun way to learn about geography and countries, so I created this progressive web app to help do that. This is an interactive quiz game where you can learn about countries, capitals, and flags all at the same time. With 2 game modes (multiple choice & free response) and lots of options for questions/answers (see image below), there is a lot you can learn. Please check out the live demo below or refer to the screen shots. Also this is a PWA so feel free to Share > "Add to Home Screen" for a better mobile experience.
